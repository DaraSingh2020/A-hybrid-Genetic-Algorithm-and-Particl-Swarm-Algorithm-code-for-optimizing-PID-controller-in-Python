# A-hybrid-Genetic-Algorithm-and-Particl-Swarm-Algorithm-code-for-optimizing-PID-controller-in-Python
This code is written in Python and it is meant to optimize parameter tuning of PID controller. The algorithm is basically a combination of Genetic Algorthm and a Particle Swarm algorithm that work together.
