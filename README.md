# A-hybrid-Genetic-Algorithm-and-Particl-Swarm-Algorithm-code-for-optimizing-PID-controller-in-Python
This repository contains a few Python codes that optimizes PID controller parameters. The algorithm is basically a combination of Genetic Algorthm and a Particle Swarm algorithm that work together. I have also uploaded PID controller design/optimization with Genetic Algorithm with Python and PID controller optimization/design using Particle Swarm Algorithm. I wrote these codes in May and June 2020 and I am sure that it can be further optimized but it works and each run doesn't take more than a minute on my PC. Please feel free to contact me or cite my work, if you intend to use these codes.
